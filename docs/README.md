## Philosophy

> "We're in the dial-up days of AI. This is what it looks like when we start building for broadband."

Simulated Creativity is about **transparent, human-controlled AI collaboration**. We're building alternatives to engagement-optimized systems by:

- Making AI deliberation visible (Lighthouse)
- Demonstrating practical applications (Body Works)
- Open-sourcing everything we can
- Measuring success in smiles, not dollars
